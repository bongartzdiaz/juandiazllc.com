# Project memory — juandiazllc.com

Next.js 16 + Prisma 7 + Supabase marketing site + Philly CRM app.
Tests run via Vitest: `npm test`. Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`. Build: `npm run build`.

## Locales
Four supported: `en`, `nl`, `de`, `es` (see `lib/i18n/dict.ts`).
`translate()` falls back to `en` when a key is missing, so missing keys show
as English — treat that as a translation bug, not a feature. Keep the key
sets identical across all four dictionaries.

When adding public-facing marketing copy, route it through `useT()` from
`@/lib/i18n/useT`. Do NOT hardcode English in `components/sections/*`. If the
string contains `<b>` / `<em>` tags, read it via `t(key)` and render with
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (content is author-controlled in `dict.ts`, so this
is safe).

## Test coverage (as of 2026-04-19)
~1% file coverage — only `lib/philly/crypto|two-factor|rate-limit|logger.test.ts`.
Priority gaps: auth-helpers (`requireScope`/`requireRole`), Zod validation
schemas under `lib/philly/validation/`, server actions in `app/actions/*`,
the 120 API routes under `app/philly/api/`, `proxy.ts` middleware (CSRF),
2FA recovery-code flow. Start new tests with validation schemas — highest
ROI, no mocks needed. See commit history on
`claude/analyze-test-coverage-WBVSQ` for the full analysis.

## Session log

### 2026-04-19 — `claude/analyze-test-coverage-WBVSQ`
- Audited test coverage (findings above).
- Replaced the Hero WebGL scene with a clean earth-globe look: solid sphere
  core with Fresnel rim, lat/long wireframe grid, back-face atmospheric halo,
  three inclined orbital rings with satellite nodes, sparse ambient data
  points. Same green palette (`#0B3D2E`, `#0E6B44`, `#1F8F5C`, `#2EC489`).
  Previous noise-displaced icosahedron looked organic/virus-like.
- Fixed i18n leaks: `Story.tsx` and `Chapters.tsx` had hardcoded English
  copy that leaked through NL/DE/ES pages. Added `story.tl.*`, `story.body.p*`,
  `story.sign.role`, `ch.word`, `ch.N.{eyebrow,title,body,meta}` keys in all
  four locales. Added missing `nav.insights` to NL and DE.
- Opened PR #3 against main. Vercel Git integration picks up the branch
  push as a preview deploy; merging to main ships production.
- Device optimization pass in `app/globals.css` (appended block):
  - tablet (641-1024) gets proper 2-col grids for signals + ventures +
    insights-related + dashboard stat-strip (previously jumped 3→1 / 6→12)
  - `(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` block strips lift/glow/translate
    hover effects that were sticking after tap; enforces ≥44px touch
    targets (WCAG 2.5.5) for `.btn` and nav links
  - `100dvh` fallback for hero/auth/philly-hero on browsers that support
    dynamic viewport units (fixes iOS URL-bar collapse jank)
  - large-screen cap (≥1680px) so display type doesn't run away on 4K
  - landscape-phone guard (`max-height: 560px`) reclaims vertical space
  - print stylesheet hides all animated chrome
- **Globe reliability rebuild.** WebGL globe was invisible on every device
  tested (suspected: fingerprinting shields + some mobile GPUs silently
  dropping the context). Rebuilt as a pure CSS-3D globe — no WebGL, no
  Three.js, no canvas. Hero.tsx now generates 12 meridians (pre-rotated on
  Y) and 7 parallels (rotateX 90° + translateY sin(lat)·50% + scale cos(lat))
  inside a `transform-style: preserve-3d` rotor. Rotation is genuine 3D
  via a single `rotateY` animation on the rotor, so every ring rotates
  with it correctly. Works on every browser, every device, regardless of
  fingerprinting/battery/reduced-motion settings. Reduced-motion users
  get a still globe. Classes: `.hero-stage .hero-starfield .hero-globe3d
  .globe-rotor .globe-core .globe-atmosphere .globe-meridian .globe-parallel
  .globe-specular .globe-orbit .orbit-sat`.
- **"Stunning" polish pass on the hero.** Nebula background (layered
  radial gradients + aurora wash), multi-layer starfield (bright + fine
  dust) with twinkle, two shooting stars sweeping diagonally, pulsing
  aurora halo around the globe, atmospheric rim glow that breathes
  (4s), gentle float (9s), satellites get a radial highlight, a comet
  trail and richer drop-shadows, specular highlight uses
  `mix-blend-mode: screen` for a genuine lit-from-above feel.
