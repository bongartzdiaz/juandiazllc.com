# Project memory — juandiazllc.com

Next.js 16 + Prisma 7 + Supabase marketing site + Philly CRM app.
Tests run via Vitest: `npm test`. Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`. Build: `npm run build`.

## Locales
Four supported: `en`, `nl`, `de`, `es` (see `lib/i18n/dict.ts`).
`translate()` falls back to `en` when a key is missing, so missing keys show
as English — treat that as a translation bug, not a feature. Keep the key
sets identical across all four dictionaries.

When adding public-facing marketing copy, route it through `useT()` from
`@/lib/i18n/useT`. Do NOT hardcode English in `components/sections/*`. If the
string contains `<b>` / `<em>` tags, read it via `t(key)` and render with
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (content is author-controlled in `dict.ts`, so this
is safe).

## Test coverage (as of 2026-04-19)
~1% file coverage — only `lib/philly/crypto|two-factor|rate-limit|logger.test.ts`.
Priority gaps: auth-helpers (`requireScope`/`requireRole`), Zod validation
schemas under `lib/philly/validation/`, server actions in `app/actions/*`,
the 120 API routes under `app/philly/api/`, `proxy.ts` middleware (CSRF),
2FA recovery-code flow. Start new tests with validation schemas — highest
ROI, no mocks needed. See commit history on
`claude/analyze-test-coverage-WBVSQ` for the full analysis.

## Session log

### 2026-04-19 — `claude/analyze-test-coverage-WBVSQ`
- Audited test coverage (findings above).
- Replaced the Hero WebGL scene with a clean earth-globe look: solid sphere
  core with Fresnel rim, lat/long wireframe grid, back-face atmospheric halo,
  three inclined orbital rings with satellite nodes, sparse ambient data
  points. Same green palette (`#0B3D2E`, `#0E6B44`, `#1F8F5C`, `#2EC489`).
  Previous noise-displaced icosahedron looked organic/virus-like.
- Fixed i18n leaks: `Story.tsx` and `Chapters.tsx` had hardcoded English
  copy that leaked through NL/DE/ES pages. Added `story.tl.*`, `story.body.p*`,
  `story.sign.role`, `ch.word`, `ch.N.{eyebrow,title,body,meta}` keys in all
  four locales. Added missing `nav.insights` to NL and DE.
