# Claims — one source of truth

Every number and factual claim used in marketing copy lives here once. Copy on
any surface quotes this file; nothing invents its own figure.

This exists because the same claim was appearing with different numbers in
different places. On 2026-07-21, live and public simultaneously:

| Claim | diazatlas.com | Elsewhere |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AutoCAD LT price | `$455/yr` | `$575/year` — the 30-post social captions pack, EN and ES |
| Diaz Editor regular price | `€997` | `€1,000` — pv-string-sizer README on GitHub |

Neither is a style problem. A competitor price that is wrong is misleading
advertising, and two different prices for your own product reads as
carelessness to exactly the buyer who is comparing carefully.

## Rules

1. **A number appears here or it does not get published.** No figure goes
   straight into copy.
2. **Every competitor claim carries a source and a date.** Vendor pricing
   changes; an undated claim rots silently.
3. **Nothing that implies traction we do not have.** No customer counts, no
   revenue, no testimonials, no "trusted by". As of 2026-07-21 there has been
   no completed purchase — all six issued licences are manual grants, two of
   them to family. Any success claim is false today.
4. **When a number changes, change it here, then grep for the old value.**

## Diaz Editor — pricing

| Claim | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Founding Beta price | €99, one-time | ✅ verified — `unit_amount: 9900` in `diaz-beta-checkout` |
| Founding Beta cap | 100 spots | ✅ verified — `public_beta_status.cap = 100` |
| Founding spots taken | 2 | ✅ verified — `public_beta_status.sold`, changes; never hardcode |
| Regular price after beta | €997, one-time | ✅ decided 2026-07-21 — chosen over €1,000 because it already appeared on the site, pricing page and checkout |
| Subscription | None. One-time purchase. | ✅ verified — Stripe `mode: 'payment'`, not `subscription` |
| Updates | Lifetime | ✅ product promise, no expiry in licence issuance |
| Trial | 14 days, no card | ✅ verified — `diaz-trial-init` |
| Educational tier | €500 | ✅ live Payment Link on the homepage |

~~**Action:** pick €997 or €1,000 and make both surfaces agree.~~ **Done
2026-07-21.** €997 it is; the pv-string-sizer README was corrected to match.
The remaining risk is the same one repeating: four surfaces carry prices, and
nothing enforces that they agree. When this number next changes, grep for the
old value across all four before calling it done.

## Competitor pricing — every one needs a dated source

Checked 2026-07-21 against each vendor's own checkout, US pricing in USD.
**Three of the four were wrong**, and one product no longer exists under the
name we used.

| Product | Was in copy | Actual | Source | Checked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AutoCAD LT | `$455/yr` (site), `$575/year` (captions) | **$540/year** | autodesk.com/products/autocad-lt/buy | 2026-07-21 |
| Revit | `$2,805/year` (captions) | **$3,005/year** | autodesk.com/products/revit/buy | 2026-07-21 |
| Autodesk Fusion | `$545/yr` as "Fusion 360" (site) | **$680/year** list, $510 first-year promo | autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/buy | 2026-07-21 |
| SketchUp Pro | `$349/yr`, `€349`, "349 Euro" | **$399/year** ($33.25/mo billed annually) | sketchup.trimble.com/en/plans-and-pricing | 2026-07-23 |
| SketchUp Studio | `$699/yr` | **$819/year** ($68.25/mo billed annually) | sketchup.trimble.com/en/plans-and-pricing | 2026-07-23 |

Three notes that matter more than the numbers:

1. **"Fusion 360" is now "Autodesk Fusion".** Naming a competitor's product
   wrong is a small thing that a comparison-shopper notices immediately.
2. **Fusion's price depends on tier and promo.** $680 is list for Fusion for
   Design; there is a 25%-off first year at $510, and cheaper tiers exist. A
   single number for Fusion is always going to be an approximation — say which
   tier, or drop it.
3. **These are USD — and that is the vendor's own currency.** Trimble and
   Autodesk list in USD on their own pricing pages; even SketchUp's German
   locale shows "$33,25 USD". Every €-denominated competitor figure our copy
   ever carried was an invention, not a vendor price. Quote USD, always.

~~**Action:** one person, one afternoon, six vendor pages.~~ **Done, all four
verified** (three on 2026-07-21, SketchUp on 2026-07-23 — the Trimble page
rendered for automated fetch on retry). The 2026-07-23 sweep (diaz-editor
PR #431) corrected 323 files including the `.md` blog sources, EUR variants
and derived 5-year totals the first sweep missed, plus the programmatic-SEO
generator templates so regeneration cannot reintroduce old numbers.
Re-check all of them before any campaign that leans on the comparison — vendor
pricing moves, and a stale figure in an ad is a legal problem rather than a
typo.

## The IFC claim — how a feature that never existed reached 1,643 places

Counted on `main` 2026-07-26: **1,643 IFC mentions across 413 files**, against
**zero lines of IFC code** in `packages/` or `apps/`. Most of it was one
templated line repeated by the programmatic-SEO generators:

> *"DXF + IFC import — works with any architect, contractor or installer"*

A second template also claimed **DWG** — the one format the rules here have
always forbidden:

> *"DXF + IFC import/export — works with architects (IFC), contractors (DWG),
> and CNC workshops (DXF)"*

Corrected 2026-07-26 (diaz-editor PR, phase 3): 1,303 templated mentions swept
mechanically, the remaining ~102 rewritten by hand because they were embedded
in advice paragraphs — including a whole H2 section explaining how to run an
IFC workflow that does not exist.

**Two lessons worth keeping:**

1. **A generator multiplies a claim.** One wrong sentence in
   `_gen-programmatic-seo*.py` became a thousand. Any claim entering a template
   deserves the scrutiny of a claim entering a contract — fix the generator, or
   the sweep undoes itself on the next regeneration.
2. **"Built" is not "shipped".** DXF import was merged and tested on
   2026-07-26, but the newest downloadable build (v0.4.46, 4 July) does not
   contain it. Claiming it the day it merges is the same error as IFC, only
   subtler: the buyer downloads and cannot find the feature. **A claim goes
   live when the release does, not when the PR does.**

**Careful with venture copy.** Describing a venture is fine. Implying it earned
a specific outcome is not, unless the number is here with a source. The
Performance Tracker copy was already corrected once for claiming inverter
integrations that do not exist in the code.

## Where copy lives

| Surface | Source of copy |
| --- | --- |
| juandiazllc.com | `lib/i18n/dict.ts` (en/nl/de/es) + `components/sections/*` |
| diazatlas.com | `diaz-editor` repo, HTML with `data-nl` / `data-de` / `data-es` attributes |
| Social posts | `diaz-content-vault` manifest + `CAPTIONS-30-POSTS-EN-ES` in `diaz-editor` |
| pv-string-sizer | its own README |

A price change touches all four. That is the point of this file.
